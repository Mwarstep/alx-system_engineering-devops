About

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure version of the HTTP protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It provides a secure and encrypted connection between a web browser and a web server. HTTPS is commonly used for secure communication on the World Wide Web, particularly for sensitive transactions such as online banking, e-commerce, and accessing secure areas of websites.

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is an older cryptographic protocol that was used to secure the communication between a client and a server. SSL has been succeeded by Transport Layer Security (TLS), but the term "SSL" is still commonly used to refer to the security certificates used for establishing secure HTTPS connections.

SSL certificates are digital files issued by trusted certificate authorities (CAs) that verify the authenticity of a website. When a website has an SSL certificate installed, it enables secure communication by encrypting the data exchanged between the web browser and the web server. This encryption helps protect sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card details, and other personal data from unauthorized access or interception.

In summary, HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, and SSL is the technology used to establish the secure connection. Together, HTTPS with SSL provides a secure and encrypted communication channel between clients and servers, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
