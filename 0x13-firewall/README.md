******0x13. Firewall******

A firewall is a security system that acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, such as the internet. It is designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

A firewall can be implemented as both a hardware or software-based solution, or a combination of both. The primary purpose of a firewall is to protect the network and its resources from unauthorized access, malicious activities, and potential threats.
